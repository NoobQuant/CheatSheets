# `conda` data science environments

**By Ville Voutilainen**

## Introduction

This article is my "cookbook recipe" on how to build tailored `conda` environments for everyday Python/R data science work. The article covers following topics:

 - How to install the environments containing fresh Python and R installations;
 - How to install packages to environments;
 - How to run Python and R instances, separately or together, in Jupyter Lab, VSCode, or RStudio.

The instructions are written for a **Windows 10 machine**. They might be applicable to other operating systems to some degree, but no guarantees are made.

## What are Anaconda, `conda`, and `conda` environments anyway?

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is a popular data science platform for multiple languages, most notably Python and R. It is also a company pursuing all kinds of ends, but here we focus on the software it provides. Anaconda software lets you run Python and R in virtual **environments**, which constitute an logically separable playing fields for your data science experiments. The environments can be fille dup with different versions of Python and R programs as well as with bundles of **packages** (or libraries) that power your work. Both environments and packages are managed with `conda`, Anaconda's packages manager.

## Why tailored `conda` environments for Python/R data science work?

Python and R are great tools for data science. The internet is full of arguments which one is better, but in my opinion these conversations miss the mark. Each one has their advantages, so there are huge benefits in being able to flexibly change between the two.

For example, Python is great for example for machine learning and writing infrastructure around the data science workflow. On the other hand, R offers a much broader set of statistical tools. The goal of this article is build an environment for data science where can employ the best parts from the other tool on the fly.

With **NoobQuantÂ® `conda` environments** one can *inter alia*

 - Run Python in VSCode or Jupyter Lab
 - Run R in RStudio or Jupyter Lab
 - Call R code from within Python with *rpy2*
 - Use typical Python data science packages such as pandas, scikit learn, matplotlib etc.
 - Use typical R data science packages such as tidyverse, ggplot2 etc.

## When not to use NoobQuant `conda` environments?

The custom environments I use are not perfect nor suited for every occasion. They have evolved based on personal preferences of someone who does most of the work in Python but needs R every now and then to run statistical analyses. NoobQuant `conda` environments proposed in this article may not be for you if:

 - You solely use R; in this case R environment management is easier and more efficient with other tools. The power of `conda` environments comes from Python package management and combining that with R or even Julia.
 - If you are afraid of getting your hands dirty: installing and managing `conda` environments with hundreds of packages might be time consuming at times, although in the long run I believe it pays for itself in reproducibility. If you do not like the extra work that comes with being able to fully customize the tools for your needs, then custom conda environments might not be your thing.

## Building tailored `conda` environments

### Download and install Anaconda

First, we need to install either Anaconda. One could also download a stripped version of Anaconda, called Miniconda, but in this article we are working with Anaconda. Anaconda distributions can be do installed from [here](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/). Miniconda distributions can be do installed from [here](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/).

**\<optional\>**

If there have been previous Anaconda installations, check that no previous specification files are haunting in directories. Typical suspects outside *Anaconda/* folder are:

 - Anconda related
    - C:\Users\<my_user_name>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Anaconda3 (64-bit)
 - Jupyter related
   - C:\Users\<my_user_name>\.jupyter
   - C:\Users\<my_user_name>\.ipynb_checkpoints
   - C:\Users\<my_user_name>\.ipython
   - C:\ProgramData\jupyter
   - C:\Users\<my_user_name>\AppData\Roaming\jupyter
 - `conda` related
   - C:\Users\<my_user_name>\.conda
 - Python packages related
   - C:\Users\<my_user_name>\.matplotlib
   - C:\Users\<my_user_name>\.keras
   - etc.
 - Windows environment variables: remove all Anaconda related

**\</optional\>**

In this version of the article we use Anaconda version *2020.02-Windows-x86_64*. Download and run the installer. Install the software to preferred path. When installing, uncheck *"Register Anaconda3 as my default Python"* (we don't want to use Python in `base` environment as our default). Also check the *"add to path"* checkbox (although it is not recommended by the wizard). Following window paths added are
  - *~/Anaconda3*
  - *~/Anaconda3/Library/mingw-w64/bin*
  - *~/Anaconda3/Library/usr/bin*
  - *~/Anaconda3/Library/bin*
  - *~/Anaconda3/Scripts*

### Installing environments

Open Anaconda prompt, where most commands below will be given. We start by telling `conda` to add a few extra channels to the list where to look for packages: *conda-forge* and *r*. Python packages tend to be faster available in *conda-forge* than in default channels. *r* is needed for R packages.

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --add channels r
```

Next, install [mamba](https://github.com/TheSnakePit/mamba) in the `base` conda environment. Later we'll replace `conda` commands with `mamba` for increased speed:

```
conda install mamba
```

Now we install the custom `conda` environment. There are two tested *NoobQuant* `conda` environments and either of them can be installed. One can also install both, but make sure to complete the installation fully for one before starting with another.

 - `dev_2018`: Year 2018 version with Python 3.6.10 and R 3.6.0
 - `dev_2021`: Year 2021 version with Python 3.8.5 and R 3.6.3

To create build either one, run command for desired environment as detailed in next two subsections.

#### dev_2018: Year 2018 version with Python 3.6.10 and R 3.6.0

```
mamba create --name dev2018 anaconda python=3.6 numpy=1.16.4 numpy-base=1.16.4 tzlocal=2.0.0 pandas=0.25.0 seaborn=0.11.0 rpy2==2.9.4 r=3.6.0 r-base=3.6.0 r-essentials=3.6.0 r-tidyverse=1.2.1 rtools=3.4.0 r-rjsdmx=2.1_0 r-seasonal=1.7.0 rstudio=1.1.456
```

#### dev_2021: Year 2021 version with Python 3.8.5 and R 3.6.3**

```
mamba create --name dev2021 anaconda=2020.11 rpy2=3.4.2 r-base=3.6.3 r-essentials=3.6 rtools=3.4.0 r-rjsdmx=2.1_0 r-seasonal=1.8.1
```
Notes about dev_2021:
 - There is a problem with *rstudio* installation. Version 1.1.456, which is the newest currently available in `conda`, seems too old for this set-up. This causes and error and prevents installment of RStudio to `dev_2021`. We might be able to use a standalone installation of RStudio and connect it to this R installation, but this might lead to problems when switching between R installations (tried using RStudio from different `conda` environment, this led to R crashing and prevention of RStudio from launching again). For this reason, before *rstudio* package is updated for Anconda we will not install RStudio to `dev_2021`.

### Jupyter kernel set-up for new environments

Now that a new environment is set up, in order to use the installed newly Python and R versions in Jupyter we need to install *kernels* that tell Jupyter from where to look for the programs. To this end, we specify kernels with unique names so that we can have multiple IPython/IR kernels for different `conda` environments (see [here](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html)).

Run following commands, changing the names depending which environment (`dev_2018` or `dev_2021`) was installed. In the examples in rest of the article, we use `dev_2021`.

```
conda activate dev2021
python -m ipykernel install --user --name dev2021_py --display-name "dev2021_py"
R
IRkernel::installspec(name='dev2021_r', displayname='dev2021_r')
quit()
```

This should add two folders under Jupyter kernels directory (typically under *C:\Users\<myusername>\AppData\Roaming\jupyter\kernels*). Check that the folders are created.

### Jupyter kernel set-up for new environments

Finally, run test files to see everything works:

 - python.py (e.g. in VSCode)
 - python.ipynb (in VSCode or Jupyter)
 - R.R (in RStudio installed with environment)
 - R.ipynb (in Jupyter)

See more in section *Using NoobQuant conda environments* below on how to run the examples.

## Using NoobQuant `conda` environments

In this section we cover tips on how to use the new `conda` environment. No matter where the Python/R instances are run, there are some general tips that one should consider:

 - Make sure Python executable points to one in the new `conda` environment (check with `import sys; print(sys.executable)`). The path should be something like *~/Anaconda3/envs/<env_name>/python.exe*. Also make sure that Python import paths include the packages directory of the new environment (check with `print(sys.path)`). The path should be something like *~/Anaconda3/envs/dev~*.
 - Make sure R executable points to one in the new `conda` environment (check with `print(file.path(R.home("bin"))`). The path should be something like *~/Anaconda3/envs/<env_name>/lib/R/bin/x64*. Also make sure R import paths contain **only** the packages directory of the new environment (`print(.libPaths())`). The path should be something like *~/Anaconda3/envs/dev/lib/R/library*. If there are other paths, set `.libPaths()` anew to contain only one path.

### Using Python and R in Jupyter Lab

To launch a Python/R instance from the tailored `conda` environment in Jupyter Lab notebook, first select the environment and launch Jupyter Lab:

```
conda activate dev2021
jupyter lab
```

This opens up Jupyter Lab in the browser. If Jupyter kernels of the new environment were correctly set up, they will be visible on the launcher page. Test running *python.ipynb* in a Python `dev2021_py` instance and *R.ipynb* in a Python `dev2021_py` instance. If installation has succeeded, the example should work.

Notice that in *python.ipynb* there are examples on how to leverage package *rpy2* to call R from within Python!

There are some common problems that might arise when running Python or R instances in Jupyter.

- If Jupyter kernel dying/restarting when running rpy2 commands, the reason might be that `R HOME` path is not set and rpy2 does not find the R installation that came with the environment. In this case we need to add it for this particular Python kernel:
  - Find the *kernel.json* for Python Jupyter kernel (e.g. *jupyter/dev2021_py/kernel.json*)
  - Add ```"env": {"R_HOME":"/home/your/anaconda3/envs/my-env-name/lib/R"}```, see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60869259/7037299). Also helpful might be [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39347782/getting-segmentation-fault-core-dumped-error-while-importing-robjects-from-rpy2/53639407#53639407).
- One problem with R Jupyter notebooks might be that if `.libPaths()` contains other paths (from different standalone R versions) that precede the correct one of the `conda` environment, on notebook loadout wrong packages might be loaded (but not attached) which cannot be reloaded again. This might cause compatibility problems with other packages. Perhaps the solution is to be pedantic about R packages management: do not install any R packages into *HOME* path where other R versions might pick them up. Always use separate package folders (outside of *HOME*) for each R version.
- In theory, Python and R kernels of the new `conda` environment should be accessible in Jupyter when run from `base` environment, see [here](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) under section *"you can make your IPython kernel in one env available to Jupyter in a different env"*. However, I have run to all kinds of problems with the R kernel, e.g. [this](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel/issues/309), [this](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/issues/353), and R installation not being found when called from Python instance with *rpy2*. Thus, I have found it easier to use Jupyter Lab from each `conda` environment separately. This is why we install Jupyter in every environment and not just in `base` as usually suggested (see e.g. discussion [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39623487/7037299)). Make sure to launch Jupyter from custom environment (e.g. ```conda activate dev2021; jupyter lab```).

### Using Python and R in VSCode

VSCode is one the best overall IDE's for data science. Thanks to its many plugins we can run both Python and R from our custom `conda` in VSCode.

- **Python**: Make sure the desired custom environment (e.g. `dev2021`) Python interpreter is selected. Then from the *.py* file, right-clock and *Run Python file in terminal*. This creates a new Python terminal and executes the file. One can also *Run selection/line in Python terminal* to run specific section, in which case the Python terminal jumps into Python and can run/type single commands in the terminal. ```quit()``` to close the Python connection back to terminal. One can also run file/section of it in interactive terminal, in which case VSCode launches Jupyter to create the interactive window. I would however not recommend this too much, rather use notebooks for interactive computing.
- **Python notebooks**: Make sure that VSCode launches Jupyter instance by from desired custom `conda` environment (by default VScode launches Jupyter from `base`). Two ways to do this:
  - Make sure we can run *conda* commands from powershell terminal by running in Anaconda terminal ```conda init powershell``` (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47800794/how-to-activate-different-anaconda-environment-from-powershell/54811138)). Then open powershell terminal in VSCode, run ```conda activate dev```. Then make sure that both selected Python interpreter and interpreter for Jupyter is is Python from *dev*. Now start up a Python notebook and things should work. See more [here](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/working-on-jupyter-notebooks-in-vs-code-from-virtual-conda-environment-f415726e329d).
  - Start Jupyter from desired environment in a separate Anaconda promt and in VSCode select Python interpreter from the Jupyter url that was launched.
- **R**: Cannot get this to work for some reason. Seems like VSCode does not find my *dev* R installation even though ```r.rterm.windows``` explicitly set. Maybe because R is not in PATH Variable...
  - Beside `R` extension, make sure R LSP Client
  - Full instructions [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INP-FsluDuk&t).
- **R notebooks**: Not yet possible, but coming: see [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/5078).

Some notes about using VSCode:
 - Make sure to load VSCode extensions `Python` and `R`!
 - Sometimes one might need to reinstall VSCode after new Anaconda installation, as VSCode might not be able to find kernel paths correctly. 

### Using R in RStudio

Launch RStudio from Anaconda promt:
```
conda activate dev2021
rstudio
```

### Calling R from a Python instance

FILL

## Adding packages to environments

The benefit of using `conda` environments comes from managing dependencies between packages. When installing packages with `conda`, it tries to make sure that new packages do not cause conflicts in the environment. Thus, no matter if Python or R package, **always try installing packages first via `conda`/`mamba`**:

```
conda activate <env_name>
mamba install <pckg_name>
```

**Python packages** tend to be well available via `conda`. If desired package is not availabe, one can also install packages via `pip` to the custom `conda` environment. Just make sure you are using pip installed to the `conda` environment in question. If this does not happen automatically (see *v1* below), then explicitly use `pip` of the correct `conda` environment (see *v2* below). For more information see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43729857) and [here](http://know.continuum.io/rs/387-XNW-688/images/conda-cheatsheet.pdf).

**pip install v1**
```
conda activate <env_name>
pip install <pckg_name>
```

**pip install v2**
```
conda activate <env_name>
conda install pip #if not done before
<path_to_env>/bin/pip install <pckg_name>
```

It is also possible to use manual *setup.py* installation and it should be enough to just activate the environment: ```conda activate dev; python /path/to/mypackage/setup.py install```, or replace *install* with *develop*. See [here)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26556865/anaconda-equivalent-of-setup-py-develop). Sometime it might help to put command directory to the package directory.

**R packages** are somewhat trickier. Newer versions of R packages arrive to `conda` with a lag or might not be available at all. Then installing via `conda` won't work. In this case we can use the R instance of the environment and call ```install.packages()```:
 - Again, make sure that the only element in `.libPaths()` is the package directory for the R in in the current `conda` environment (e.g. *~/Anaconda3/envs/dev/lib/R/library*).
- Try first without installing dependencies of the package, as we might be able to install then via `conda`. That is, `install.packages("mylib", dependencies=FALSE)()))`.
- If this fails or dependencies installed via `conda` have wrong versions available, let R installation install also dependencies: `install.packages("mylib", lib="some_R_lib_path", dependencies = TRUE)`.

## Notes about producing installation files for custom environments

Once a custom environment is ready, one could export environment into construction files that can be used later to spin up the environment. However, building environments from these files does not usually work on different machines (don't know why).
 - (*OS unspecific*): Export *dev* environment to .yml ```conda env export --no-builds > nq_dev_py36_r36.yml``` (why *--no-builds* see [here](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/9480)). Remove explicit prefix from end. Then build environment later by ```conda env create --file nq_dev_py36_r36.yml```.
 - (*OS specific*): Export *dev* environment to .txt ```conda list --explicit > nq_dev_py36_r36.txt```. Then build environment later by ```conda env create --name dev --file nq_dev_py36_r36.txt```. If error raised try removing line "@EXPLICIT" from the file.
