# Frequently asked questions Statistics/Econometrics

## General statistics

- Correlation and independence: [No-correlation does not imply independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence#Correlation_and_independence). Why? Since correlation is [linear relationship similar to regression coefficient](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/344619/162538).

- What does '*certainty equivalence*' mean?: [Answer 1](https://economics.stackexchange.com/a/19898/5764), [Answer 2](https://economics.stackexchange.com/a/9554/61).

- What is the difference between *factor* and *covariate*? See [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/70826/162538).

- Expectation is minimizing squared deviation and median is minimizing absolute deviation: [here](http://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2019/10/04/expectation-median-opt/), [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/113270/the-median-minimizes-the-sum-of-absolute-deviations-the-ell-1-norm), and [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/118/why-square-the-difference-instead-of-taking-the-absolute-value-in-standard-devia).

- Variance of random variables does not always exist: [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/4007718).
